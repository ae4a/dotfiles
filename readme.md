My hyprland rice!

Now the main feature is my fully custom eww bar

# Main parts
- hyprland
- rofi
- kitty, zsh
- neovim
- obsidian
- zsh

# Details
## Color theme
I use [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) in all places I could.
## Eww
I didn't like waybar because I wanted more flexebility and control. 
I was looking for a good eww bar but the ones that I found either were not ideal or did not work.
So I made my own. Now it is still in development. Special thanks to [Aylur](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles) and [Saimoomedits](https://github.com/Saimoomedits/eww-widgets)  What I am proud of are popups!!! now only for volume and brightness. 

So now it has:
- workspaces
- active window
- system info(cpu, ram)
- volume
- brightness
- wifi
- battery
- clock

I am planning to add:
- bluetooth
- vpn
- maybe player
- quick settings or control center menu
- powermenu
- lock pause

### Requirements
- pipewire(pactl, wpctl)
- networkManager
- brightnessctl
